# Configure ports and run

### Configure ports

Your Diva client needs to talk to other nodes in order to perform signatures, receive duties, and find peers. For that reason:

- The port `5050` is used for P2P communication and **MUST** be open and exposed in your machine.
- The port `30000` is used to access the swagger API of your node and you **SHOULD** keep it open if you want to use the Operator UI.
- The port `80` is used by the Operator UI and you **SHOULD** open it if you want to serve the Operator UI.

You could also run the Operator UI locally on your laptop and connect to the port `30000` of your Diva client using a VPN, keeping access to your node as constrained as possible.

### Run Diva with Docker compose
Finally, to run your node, execute the following command:

```bash
# Run the docker compose file
docker compose up -d
```

Your node should be up and running, ready to continue the setup using the Operator UI as described in [Register your node](/testnet/install/register).
