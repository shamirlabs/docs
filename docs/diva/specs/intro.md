# Introduction

The Diva Staking Protocol is a trustless staking system that enables stakers to stake their Ethereum (ETH) without requiring trust in any counterparty. It is designed to improve the lives of stakers and operators by providing liquid staking powered distributed validation in a permissionless and trustless manner.

In the Diva Staking Protocol, stakers can stake their ETH and receive divETH, a liquid staking token that generates Ethereum staking rewards. Operators can run nodes from a minimum of collateral ETH, as opposed to a stake of 32 ETH from Ethereum.

The protocol is powered by Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), which is a fully integrated tool that improves the protocol's resiliency and reduces single points of failure.
