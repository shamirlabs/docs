# Register your node

Follow the instructions of this video to setup and register your node using the Diva Operator web UI.

To do that, you will need to access the Diva operator web UI in any of two ways:

- Local: `http://localhost`
- Remote: `http://YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP`

If you access to it remotely, remember typing `YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP:30000` when asked for the API URL of your node.

Having issues? Ask in #operator-testnet of [Diva's community Discord](https://discord.gg/nektarnetwork).

Once your node is registered, you can [start validating!](validate)

## Test the Swagger API (optional)

If you are a developer and want to play around with the Diva API, you can make calls to your node API. All the API calls are documented in the Swagger API at `YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP:30000/swagger/index.html`. 

To access some of those API calls, you must first authenticate yourself. As shown in the following video, to authenticate click on `Authorize` and type `Bearer DIVA_API_KEY`, where `DIVA_API_KEY` is the password that you configured when installing Diva.
