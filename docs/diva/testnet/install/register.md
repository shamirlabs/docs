# Register your node

Follow the instructions of this video to setup and register your node using the Diva Operator web UI.

To do that, you will need to access to the Diva operator web UI in any of two ways:

- Local: `http://localhost`
- Remote: `http://YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP`

If you access to it remotely, remember typing `YOUR_NODE_PUBLIC_IP:30000` when asked for the API URL of your node.

Having issues? Ask in #operator-testnet of [Diva's community Discord](https://discord.gg/diva).

Once your node is registered, you can [start validating!](validate)
